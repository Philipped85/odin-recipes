          <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>We fixed the chicken burger, and all it really took was stirring in a couple spoons of chimichurri sauce. No longer sort of dry and kind of boring, this is one of the best burgers you'll ever have.</p>

               <h4>Chicken Burgers</h4>
               
                <ul>
                    <p><li>1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs</li></p>
                    <p><li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li></p>
                    <p><li>2 tablespoons breadcrumbs (optional)</li></p>
                    <p><li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li></p> 
                    <p><li>1/3 cup mayonnaise</li></p>
                </ul>

                <h4>Steps</h4>

                  <ol>
                    <p><li>To make chimichurri, chop herbs with a sharp knife until fine; add sliced garlic to the mixture. Continue chopping until mixture is very fine; transfer to a bowl. Stir in the 1/4 cup olive oil, white wine vinegar, the 1/4 teaspoon salt, black pepper, cumin, and red pepper flakes. Wrap and refrigerate until needed.</li></p>
                    <p><li>To make burgers, place chicken thighs in the freezer until firm and half-frozen, about 30 minutes.</li></p>
                    <p><li>Place thighs on a cutting board, and using a large sharp knife or heavy cleaver, chop until it resembles coarsely ground meat. (Alternatively, place chicken in a food processor; pulse on and off, scraping sides often, until texture resembles coarsely ground meat.)</li></p>
                    <p><li>Transfer chicken to a bowl, add the 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 cup chimichurri sauce. Use a fork to mix thoroughly.</li></p>
                    <p><li>Using damp hands, form chicken mixture into 4 equal-sized patties, about 1/2-inch thick. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.</li></p>
                    <p><li>Stir together mayonnaise and  remaining chimichurri sauce to make spread for buns; refrigerate until needed.</li></p>
                    <p><li>Remove burgers from the fridge; sprinkle both sides with breadcrumbs.</li></p>
                    <p><li>Add olive oil to a large non-stick skillet and set over medium high heat. When hot, but before oil starts smoking, add burgers, and cook about 5 minutes per side, or until chicken is cooked through. An instant read thermometer inserted near the center should read 145 to 150 degrees F (63 to 65 degrees C).</li></p>
                    <p><li>Let burgers rest for a minute or two. Serve on buns spread with chimichurri mayo and the fixings of your choice.</li></p>
                  </ol>
